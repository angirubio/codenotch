        <h1>Welcome to 90's</h1>
        <p>Ah, the 1990s – the decade that brought you indie-cinema breakouts and bullet-time blockbusters, fight clubs
            and foul-mouthed clerks, charismatic cannibal serial killers and “Choose Life!” sloganeering, Rushmore
            Academy overachievers and Royales with Cheese. Looking back on the movies that made the Nineties such a
            surprisingly fertile period for filmmakers and film lovers, you can see how so much of the foundation for
            the past few decades was laid so early on, from the rise of documentaries as a mainstream phenomenon to the
            meta touches that would turn so many mix-and-match movies into wax museums with pulses. Sundance was to
            independent auteurs as Seattle was to grunge rockers. We would hang with slackers and Scottish junkies,
            smooth-talking criminals and abiding dudes. We would get cyberpunk as fuck. We would know kung fu – whoa!

            So we’ve assembled a crack team of film fanatics, culture vultures, pop-culture pundits and various critics
            to weigh in on the 100 greatest movies of the Nineties. From Oscar-winners to obscure-but-wonderful gems,
            nonfiction social-issue sagas to a seven-hour Hungarian masterpiece, Titanic to Tarantino, these are the
            films we still argue over, quote endlessly and return to again and again. Crank up your dial-up connection,
            crack open a Zima and let the arguments begin.

                <h3>Clreks (1994)</h3>
                <p>Shot in grainy black and white and loosely based on director Kevin Smith’s life at the time, this
                    no-budget film follows a convenience store clerk (Brian O’Halloran), and his video-store-clerk best
                    friend (Jeff Anderson) over the course of a single day. Clerks captures both the banality of service
                    work and a sort of dirtbag-vérité weirdness that would end up becoming a go-to template for Nineties
                    indie movies; just for kicks, he throws in a stoner duo (hello, Jay and Silent Bob!) that would end
                    up
                    becoming the cornerstone of the Smithverse. Between its foul-mouthed running commentary on
                    everything
                    from Star Wars to dicks and its dead-on sense of grungy ennui, Smith’s D.I.Y. debut captures a
                    certain
                    post-Slacker cultural moment and traps it in amber. AB</p>

                <h3>Titanic (1997)</h3>
                <p>A flower-child, a macho fetishist, a tech nerd – James Cameron can be all these things at once. And
                    with this tragic romance set aboard the doomed, iceberg-bound ocean liner, he proved he could speak
                    fluent
                    teenager as well. Yes, Titanic‘s amazing effects and impressively choreographed scenes of chaos
                    recreate the sinking ship going down with FX-heavy fidelity. But an entire generation of moviegoers
                    still embrace this megablockbuster because Cameron crafted an earnest, swooning romance between two
                    kids, and in Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, he found two ideal actors – perched between teen
                    stardom and adulthood, able to convey both free-spirited puppy love and genuine depth and despair.
                    Come for the awe-inspiring spectacle; stay for the breathtaking moments of tenderness. BE</p>

                <h3>Fear and loathing in Las Vegas (1998)</h3>
                <p>Only Terry Gilliam could mount such a chaotic and kaleidoscopic adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson’s
                    gonzo dispatch – a mescaline-penned eulogy for the Summer of Love and an eerie premonition of the
                    Watergate era. Johnny Depp completely embodies the late, great journalist as his “Raoul Duke”
                    teeters along the Las Vegas Strip and inhales an ether-soaked American flag, with Benicio Del Toro’s
                    unhinged lawyer playing the buzzing Bonnie to our tour guide’s acid-fried Clyde. The film’s bizarre
                    epilogue: Seven years after its release, Depp helped fire Thompson’s ashes out of a cannon at the
                    writer’s funeral. DK</p>

                <h3>Terminator 2: Judgment Day(1991)</h3>
                <p>It’s not the T-1000 that makes James Cameron’s sequel better than his brilliant 1984 B-movie original
                    –– although an indefatigable orb that can melt, shatter and reconstitute itself is a lot more
                    menacing than today’s supervillains. No, the glory belongs to the film’s ripped-up in-house Wonder
                    Woman: The director’s then-wife Linda Hamilton, reprising her role as a fierce Madonna who must
                    protect her savior-in-the-making son (Edward Furlong). Young John Connor’s bond with Arnold
                    Schwarzenegger’s increasingly sentient, former killing machine is touching, and the violence is
                    deftly orchestrated. But Hamilton’s muscular transformation and badass military bearing is what
                    really gives shape to this ultimate showdown between creation and destruction. It’s comforting to
                    believe that tough mothers can help prevent the apocalypse – then and now. PR</p>
